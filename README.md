## Dataset + PowerBI

## Description:
Project path 2 was choosen for the IoT project. Power BI was used as a visualization tool for the selected dataset. Also, as the pre-requisite the Power BI learning path was also completed. A Financial data consisting of 700 rows was choosen for the data analysis. Key insights, Dashboard screenshots and videos are described in the sections below.

**Dataset**

* Financial Data consists of data collected from various countries w.r.t various products and segments. Following are the few important features displayed in this dataset:
    * Countries
    * Sales
    * Profit
    * Segments
    * Product
    * Discount Band
The diversity of the data along with the 700 entries was one of the main reasons for selecting this dataset. Following is the screenshot for the selected data:

**Relevant Problems**

1. Difficult to get the sales/segment-wise/profit visualization.
2. There are too many parameters which have to be considered for making a decision. 
3. Getting the highest sold products - both month wise and annually is difficult with normal visualization tools.
4. Available tools are too time consuming.

**Key insights** (_All the insights are for the period of 1/9/13-1/12/14_)

1. Paseo was the highest sold product and also the highest profitable product, followed by VTT.
2. The highest Gross sales was made by the Government segment (56.4 Million $) globally.
3. The following countires lead the respective segments:

| Segment |Country|  
| --- | --- |
| Small business | USA |  
| Mid market  | France |  
| Government | France |  
|Enterprise | USA |
|Channel Partners | Canada|

4. Generally the sales were at the peak in October, November and December in all the segments. One of the reasons can be the Chirstmas festival preparations across the world.
5. Also, all the countries except Germany saw a sudden rise in sales around June for the midmarket segment.


## Dashboard:

The multi-page dashboard represents the sales of products for a given segment. It also provides the user with the ability to compare variety of data - country, date range, segment, month, etc. Following are the screenshots from the dashboard:
