**Description:** Often at times it is difficult to predict the sentiment of a text. This text can be in the form of a text message/tweet/news/email/etc. What if the system/app predicts the userâ€™s sentiment by analysing the text?  MoodGuesserApp is developed to predict the users sentiments. It uses the Azure text-analytics services to perform sentimental analysis.
